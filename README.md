# Camera-Intent-Description
There was a Camera API provided in the Android OS that was being used by a lot of developers, and even though it had a lot of shortcomings, developers -more or less- were able to make camera-applications. Camera2 saw a lot of changes made by Google, because of the advent of the secondary camera, or the front camera and therefore there were new methods and classes to use both of the cameras.

This repository contains the code that'll trigger the camera intent that can be used in the Camera2 API.
